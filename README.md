## Run the demo project!

```
git clone https://github.com/tfcat/Leafgem.git

Any and all contibutions to this engine are welcome and heavily appreciated, no matter how big or small. The aim is to give game devs a large and intuitive toolkit for making games!

Any ideas are welcome. Fork and work your magic!
